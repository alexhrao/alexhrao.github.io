                        <p>
                            My name is Alex Rao, and this is my personal website. Here you'll find out who I am, what I'm all about, and what I've done. You'll also find out how to contact me, if you're in to that sort of thing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Who am I? That's an interesting question. The simplest answer is that I'm a young man ready to make something of myself in this world. I was born in Atlanta, GA, but quickly moved to Birmingham, AL and eventually to Tulsa, OK - which I still call home
                            to this very day. I'm the son of two extraordinary parents, and the twin of one awesome sister. I'll answer your question before you ask it - no, my sister and I are <em>NOT</em> identical!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm very passionate about the relationship between software and hardware, and while not working, studying, or sleeping, you can usually find me hacking on some personal project. Indeed, that's the reason for the existence of all my GitHub repositories!
                            Unfortunately, experimenting with software is much easier (and cheaper) than experimenting with hardware, so I haven't had as much experience tinkering with hardware - I hope this will change soon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most projects start because of a single thought - "Wouldn't it be cool if..." Interestingly enough, most of what I know about languages comes from these projects. While I take classes in Java, Python, etc. like everyone else, it is through these projects
                            that I really <em>learned</em> these languages. As an example, I learned the Java Programming Language through the creation of <em>Sudoku Online</em>, and I really learned MATLAB&reg; through <em>SoluCheck</em>.
                            Indeed, even while doing a project, I'll think "Oh, but what if I could do...," and then I start doing.
                        </p>
                        <h5>

                            I've been blessed to have an absolutely wonderful set of parents, who placed a high value on education. As such, I went to one of the best schools in Tulsa, OK - Holland Hall College Preparatory School. I graduated from there having earned the Patrick
                            O. Morris award for outstanding intellectual, social, and ethical standards. While it may sound like I'm bragging about myself, I like to think I'm bragging about my family. It takes a village to raise a child, and the village
                            did one hell of a job with me!
                        </p>
                        <h2>The Early Years: Holland Hall &amp; High School</h2>
                        <p>
                            I went to Holland Hall from Kindergarten to Senior Year - which makes me a lifer there. I really did enjoy my time there, and I am confident that though I may wander far and wide, I will never forget my roots - and those roots started at Holland Hall.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Classroom</h3>
                        <p>
                            This was where I belong. I loved the classes at Holland Hall, especially since the classes were allowed to be interesting, engaging, and "abnormal." For example, <a href="https://www.hollandhall.org/staff/shingleton-keri/">Dr. Keri Shingleton</a>                            taught a class called <em>Microbes &amp; Diseases</em>, where we actually got to grow, test, and interact with different bacteria. Whenever I tell anyone about this class, they're response is almost always "You got to do THAT
                            in high school???" I credit most of my critical thinking abilities to Holland Hall - learning how to learn was by far the overarching goal of Holland Hall. To say that has served me well would be massive understatement.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thankfully, Dr. Shingleton was not the only wonderful teacher at Holland Hall. <a href="https://www.hollandhall.org/staff/holmes-karen/">Mrs. Karen Holmes</a> taught me mathematics, and she was darn good at it too. She was
                            so good, in fact, that she and I did an independent study together on Multivariable Calculus! To say she had a lasting impact on me would be 100% accurate. Indeed, I owe much of my mathematical ability to her teaching skills!
                        </p>
                        <h3>The Sports</h3>

                            <p>
                                I was a part of the Holland Hall Cross Country Team, all the way from 6th Grade to Senior Year. Don't be fooled - I am not a <em>fast</em> runner, but I can hold my own. Greg Spencer, my coach, actually <em>was</em> <strong>fast</strong>.
                                Like, so-fast-you-can't-see-him fast. Incidentally, he had actually graduated from Holland Hall, and his dad also taught there as well! A Holland Hall family right there. I actually did become the Men's Varsity Team Captain,
                                and I earned the prestigious "Hamburger Helper" award (It's not <em>that</em> prestigious, I guess, but still...) for keeping the tent standing during a torrential downpour. Overall, I really enjoyed Cross Country, and
                                I made some lifelong friends in that group.

                        <p>
                            Nowadays, I'm a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I'm working towards a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) with a minor in Computer Science (CS). Eventually, I hope to earn a Master's Degree, probably in Computer
                            Science. But who knows? Maybe I'll be whisked away into Philosophy. The future's an open book, and I'm just hopping one page at a time. But I wouldn't bet on the whole Philosophy thing panning out. In my heart of hearts, I
                            know I'm an Engineer.

                            <p>
                                I was very active in Boy Scouts, starting as a wee little Cub Scout. I participated in all the cool stuff, like selling popcorn and making pinewood derby cars. While mine <em>**almost**</em> won, I still learned alot from
                                the experience, not to mention that I had a lot of fun doing it! Additionally, I made some of my most important friendships and relationships during my time at Troop 26.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once I graduated to Boy Scouts, I went to BSA Troop 26, one of the largest Boy Scout troops in the United States. I quickly found that I loved it. Absolutely loved it. I became an Eagle Scout in 2012, and then became Senior Patrol Leader of Troop 26 a
                                year and a half later. Under my leadership, we went to Summer Camp, the National Jamboree, Sea Base High Adventure camp, and did a float trip down the Illinois river. Interestingly, on all four of these trips, there was
                                substantial rain. Enough rain that I stopped caring about getting wet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While Troop 26 is a wonderful troop in its own right, I give most of the credit for its size and magnificence to its Scoutmaster, Bill Shaffer. Bill has been the scoutmaster for over 40 years, and is an integral part of why Troop 26 is as successful as
                                it is today. I personally owe him a great deal, as he has given me much of my work ethic and common sense.

                        <h2>Hacking</h2>
                        <p>
                            I absolutely <em>love</em> to hack. Probably not the "hack" you're thinking of. My definition of "hack" means to simply work on a personal software and/or hardware project. All of my GitHub repositories arose from my "hacking."
                            Which one's my favorite? Good question. As of this writing, I'd probably have to say <em>Sudoku Online</em>. It's my most successful project, and it's actually used. By the same token, however, shouldn't <em>MealPlanner</em>                            be my favorite? Hmmmm...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Regardless of what my favorite project is, I think it has become evident that I like to code. I impore you to look below and view my various projects; I really am proud of them all!

                    You don't have to look far to see that I <em>LOVE</em> software. My GitHub repositories (which includes this site, by the way...), and my biography repeatedly hints at my software leanings. But it's more than that. It's software that
                    can serve. Software with a purpose. I'm passionate about making software that can change people's lives for the better. Now, many of you are thinking "Oh, he's just a kid that wants to change the world. Just like everyone else." While
                    I would like to change how this world works, my goal is a bit more... reasonable. <em>Improvements</em> are where I think I can actually make substantial impact. Making applications easier to use and available to a broader audience.
                    Making sure that websites are reasonable, and apps that allow users to make decisions faster. This is where I think I can truly make a difference.

                <p>
                    This is more... recent than anything else. I've always loved the <em>thought</em> of learning hardware - only recently have I actually been able to do so. Most of my work with embedded systems have been with the <a href="https://developer.mbed.org/users/alexhrao/">MBED</a>                    class of systems. These are small devices based on ARM architecture. With this, I've been moving closer and closer to developing for the <em>Internet of Things</em>, or <em>IOT</em>. Making a simple MBED program that can flip a switch,
                    over the internet, is something I've been working on recently. Of course, unlike other embedded system companies, I'm going to first ensure that the system is <strong>secure</strong>.

                        This is where I currently work, as a Cooperative Education employee (Co Op). For my first rotation, I worked in Transmission Planning East, which was chiefly responsible for making sure that Georgians can expect reliable power at all times. As it turns
                        out, this is quite a bit more difficult than it looks - and it already looks challenging.

                        Here, I helped improve efficiency by improving the already-existing technologies. For example, I created a form in Microsoft&trade; Access that allows users to automatically enter in new "contingency events." This dramatically reduced the precent error,
                        since before my program, the process had been completely done by hand.

                            For my first project, I was part of a team that designed a template for digitally storing all the artifacts and research of the Chickasaw Nation. A few of the things I learned from this experience:

                                    <li class="list-item">
                                        This project in particular taught me that speaking up is an important part of being a team player. If you See something, Say something&trade;. This might be from the TSA, but it really makes a difference.

                                        I also learned that delegation is important. If nobody has a specific problem to solve, it's unlikely anyone will solve anything. Indeed, without direction, nobody even knows <em>what</em> to solve. Giving clear
                                        orders is a must in any team.

                            it off. It's better to promise less and then deliver more than the other way around!

                        At the University of Tulsa, I interned as an assistant researcher in Mechanical, Chemical, and Electrical Engineering. Specifically, we were testing the strengths of different epoxies, which were utilized in fixing fissures in underwater oil pipelines.
                        I worked under TU professor Dr. Michael Keller and Graduate Student Chris Burnworth, both of whom were experts in their respective fields.

                        Specifically, we made 60 pipes with fabricated deficiencies, and then saw how much pressure was required to blow the pipe. Then, after fixing this hole with epoxy, we'd see how much pressure the pipe could take before bursting again.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, we also made extraordinarily thin plates out of the same epoxy. Using paint-on electrical wiring, I drew across the plate and connected the paint to a wire, which led to NI equipment connected to a LabVIEW-equipped computer. Using LabVIEW,
                        I then created an experiment which logged measured resistance across the line, subtracting out the resistance of the wire. Then, a constantly increasing stretching force was applied to the plate, until the plate broke. Since the
                        resistance would increase dramatically as soon as the plate broke, reading this resistance was integral in figuring out <em>exactly</em> how strong the plate was.

                                Sudoku Online was a labor of love. It was originally made so that a certain young lady and I could keep in touch while I studied abroad, but I'm happy to report that it's been used even outside of this context. This project was born out a "I wonder if
                                this is even possible..." thought. I have, of course, since found out that <em>it is indeed possible</em>.

                            <p>
                                Writing this application actually taught me quite a bit about the Java Programming Language and how modern networking works. Ideas like sockets, servers, and streams were introduced to me for the very first time. Multithreaded programming became second
                                nature. Overall, I actually learned more creating this than I learned in my classes!

                                MealPlanner was created out of a desire to electronically plan meals. Incidentally, it's actually actively used, but only by me. It's written in PHP&trade;. It allows users to create records for ingredients, recipes, and meals, and then schedule these
                                meals. It then allows users to view a calendar of their meals, and to get a shopping list of what they need to buy for a certain range of dates.

                                SoluCheck is my very first real "Program" - it has an installer, a GUI, and is extraordinarily user friendly. It's created entirely in MATLAB&reg;, and uses MATLAB&reg;'s GUI elements.

                                    SoluCheck was started from a desire to be lazy. For CS 1371 (A class which I now TA for), we have to create code that will, theoretically, solve a given problem for <em>any</em> starting conditions. These starting conditions
                                    are given as inputs to MATLAB&reg; functions, or as external files (i.e., text files, image files, etc.).

                                    <p>
                                        Originally a command-line utility, it consisted of one function - Solver - that took in a function name (as a string), a "number of iterations" (how many times solver would test the function), and a variable number of arguments - arguments that specify
                                        the starting argument and the "step size" for that argument. Basically, solver would increment the argument by its step size each successive iteration. This was clunky, to say the least, and for a large number of
                                        arguments, would quickly go out of hand with number of arguments. Indeed, the first solver didn't even work!
                                    </p>

                                        Still a command-line utility, this time the solver at least worked... but only for numbers. Characters caused the solver to straight up die, and error checking? Look who's asking for the moon.

                                        Now this time, there was no real "hot new thing" - it was just bug fixes. It was becoming clear at this point that a GUI would be almost a requirement - the argument entry was becoming nightmarish!

                                        This is it. The beginning of SoluCheck, SoluWare (The "parent company" responsible for SoluCheck - I had my head in the clouds). The world's first (and still only!) GUI that will programmatically check homework for a variety of test cases. Mind you, there
                                        are still some problems. The business logic and presentation logic are still combined - not good for any product, and there are still a variety of arguments not testable. But it's a start.

                                Like Sudoku Online, this one was born out of a simple thought - "I wonder if this is possible..." I was studying Chess algorithms, and I realized that it was possible for a computer to track moves. At the time, the only real "programming language" I knew
                                was MATLAB&reg;, so I got to work, and wrote the first Chess Player for MATLAB.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Supported wherever MATLAB GUIs are supported, the app will track player moves and keep a log of them, which can be docked or free-floating. It also ensures that checkmate is valid, and won't let the player put his or her King into harm's way. The game
                                highlights squares that are valid moves, albeit using an inefficient algorithm. But at the end of the day, it <em>works</em>, and it taught me a good bit about MATLAB&reg;.

                                A simple project for MATLAB, and interestingly, actually originally a part of SoluCheck. Basically, it allows loading a variable number of .mat files into your workspace, using a user-friendly GUI (which I <em>personally</em>                                think is better than the one supplied by MathWorks&trade;).
