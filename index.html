                                My name is Alex Rao, and this is my personal website. Here you'll find out who I am, what I'm all about, and what I've done. You'll also find out how to contact me, if you're in to that sort of thing.
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Who am I? That's an interesting question. The simplest answer is that I'm a young man ready to make something of myself in this world. I was born in Atlanta, GA, but quickly moved to Birmingham, AL and eventually to Tulsa, OK - which I still call home to this very day. I'm the son of two extraordinary parents, and the twin of one awesome sister. I'll answer your question before you ask it - no, my sister and I are <em>NOT</em> identical!
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm very passionate about the relationship between software and hardware, and while not working, studying, or sleeping, you can usually find me hacking on some personal project. Indeed, that's the reason for the existence of all my GitHub repositories! Unfortunately, experimenting with software is much easier (and cheaper) than experimenting with hardware, so I haven't had as much experience tinkering with hardware - I hope this will change soon.
                                <br>

                                Most projects start because of a single thought - "Wouldn't it be cool if..." Interestingly enough, most of what I know about languages comes from these projects. While I take classes in Java, Python, etc. like everyone else, it is through these projects that I really <em>learned</em> these languages. As an example, I learned the Java Programming Language through the creation of <em>SudokuOnline</em>, and I really learned MATLAB&trade; through <em>SoluCheck</em>. Indeed, even while doing a project, I'll think "Oh, but what if I could do...," and then I start doing.

                            <p>
                                I've been blessed to have an absolutely wonderful set of parents, who placed a high value on education. As such, I went to one of the best schools in Tulsa, OK - Holland Hall College Preparatory School. I graduated from there having earned the Patrick O. Morris award for outstanding intellectual, social, and ethical standards. While it may sound like I'm bragging about myself, I like to think I'm bragging about my family. It takes a village to raise a child, and the village did one hell of a job with me!

                            <h2>The Early Years: Holland Hall &amp; High School</h2>
                            <p>
                                I went to Holland Hall from Kindergarten to Senior Year - which makes me a lifer there. I really did enjoy my time there, and I am confident that though I may wander far and wide, I will never forget my roots - and those roots started at Holland Hall.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The Classroom</h3>
                            <p>
                                This was where I belong. I loved the classes at Holland Hall, especially since the classes were allowed to be interesting, engaging, and "abnormal." For example, <a href="https://www.hollandhall.org/staff/holmes-karen/">Dr. Keri Shingleton</a> taught a class called <em>Microbes &amp; Diseases</em>, where we actually got to grow, test, and interact with different bacteria. Whenever I tell anyone about this class, they're response is almost always "You got to do THAT in high school???" I credit most of my critical thinking abilities to Holland Hall - learning how to learn was by far the overarching goal of Holland Hall. To say that has served me well would be massive understatement.<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thankfully, Dr. Shingleton was not the only wonderful teacher at Holland Hall. <a href="https://www.hollandhall.org/staff/shingleton-keri/">Mrs. Karen Holmes</a> taught me mathematics, and she was darn good at it too. She was so good, in fact, that she and I did an independent study together on Multivariable Calculus! To say she had a lasting impact on me would be 100% accurate. Indeed, I owe much of my mathematical ability to her teaching skills!
                            </p>

                                    I was a part of the Holland Hall Cross Country Team, all the way from 6th Grade to Senior Year. Don't be fooled - I am not a <em>fast</em> runner, but I can hold my own. Greg Spencer, my coach, actually <em>was</em> <strong>fast</strong>. Like, so-fast-you-can't-see-him fast. Incidentally, he had actually graduated from Holland Hall, and his dad also taught there as well! A Holland Hall family right there. I actually did become the Men's Varsity Team Captain, and I earned the prestigious "Hamburger Helper" award (It's not <em>that</em> prestigious, I guess, but still...) for keeping the tent standing during a torrential downpour. Overall, I really enjoyed Cross Country, and I made some lifelong friends in that group.

                                Nowadays, I'm a student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I'm working towards a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) with minor in Computer Science (CS). Eventually, I hope to earn a Master's Degree, probably in Computer Science. But who knows? Maybe I'll be whisked away into Philosophy. The future's an open book, and I'm just hopping one page at a time. But I wouldn't bet on the whole Philosophy thing panning out. In my heart of hearts, I know I'm an Engineer.

                                <p>
                                    I was very active in Boy Scouts, starting as a wee little Cub Scout. I participated in all the cool stuff, like selling popcorn and making pinewood derby cars. While mine <em>**almost**</em> won, I still learned alot from the experience, not to mention that I had a lot of fun doing it! Additionally, I made some of my most important friendships and relationships during my time at Troop 26. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once I graduated to Boy Scouts, I went to BSA Troop 26, one of the largest Boy Scout troops in the United States. I quickly found that I loved it. Absolutely loved it. I became an Eagle Scout in 2012, and then became Senior Patrol Leader of Troop 26 a year and a half later. Under my leadership, we went to Summer Camp, the National Jamboree, Sea Base High Adventure camp, and did a float trip down the Illinois river. Interestingly, on all four of these trips, there was substantial rain. Enough rain that I stopped caring about getting wet.

                                <p>
                                    While Troop 26 is a wonderful troop in its own right, I give most of the credit for its size and magnificence to its Scoutmaster, Bill Shaffer. Bill has been the scoutmaster for over 40 years, and is an integral part of why Troop 26 is as successful as it is today. I personally owe him a great deal, as he has given me much of my work ethic and common sense.

                            <p>
                                I absolutely <em>love</em> to hack. Probably not the "hack" you're thinking of. My definition of "hack" means to simply work on a personal software and/or hardware project. All of my GitHub repositories arose from my "hacking." Which one's my favorite? Good question. As of this writing, I'd probably have to say <em>SudokuOnline</em>. It's my most successful project, and it's actually used. By the same token, however, shouldn't <em>MealPlanner</em> be my favorite? Hmmmm...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Regardless of what my favorite project is, I think it has become evident that I like to code. I impore you to look below and view my various projects; I really am proud of them all!

                        You don't have to look far to see that I <em>LOVE</em> software. My GitHub repositories (which includes this site, by the way...), and my biography repeatedly hints at my software leanings. But it's more than that. It's software that can serve. Software with a purpose. I'm passionate about making software that can change people's lives for the better. Now, many of you are thinking "Oh, he's just a kid that wants to change the world. Just like everyone else." While I would like to change how this world works, my goal is a bit more... reasonable. <em>Improvements</em> are where I think I can actually make substantial impact. Making applications easier to use and available to a broader audience. Making sure that websites are reasonable, and apps that allow users to make decisions faster. This is where I think I can truly make a difference.

                        This is more... recent than anything else. I've always loved the <em>thought</em> of learning hardware - only recently have I actually been able to do so. Most of my work with embedded systems have been with the <a href="https://developer.mbed.org/users/alexhrao/">MBED</a> class of systems. These are small devices based on ARM architecture. With this, I've been moving closer and closer to developing for the <em>Internet of Things</em>, or IOT. Making a simple MBED program that can flip a switch, over the internet, is something I've been working on recently. Of course, unlike other embedded system companies, I'm going to first ensure that the system is <strong>secure</strong>.

                                    I was very active in Boy Scouts, starting as a wee little Cub Scout. I participated in all the cool stuff, like selling popcorn and making pinewood derby cars. While mine <em>**almost**</em> won, I still learned alot from the experience, not to mention that I had a lot of fun doing it! Additionally, I made some of my most important friendships and relationships during my time at Troop 26.

                                    Once I graduated to Boy Scouts, I went to BSA Troop 26, one of the largest Boy Scout troops in the United States. I quickly found that I loved it. Absolutely loved it. I became an Eagle Scout in 2012, and then became Senior Patrol Leader of Troop 26 a year and a half later. Under my leadership, we went to Summer Camp, the National Jamboree, Sea Base High Adventure camp, and did a float trip down the Illinois river. Interestingly, on all four of these trips, there was substantial rain. Enough rain that I stopped caring about getting wet.

                                    While Troop 26 is a wonderful troop in its own right, I give most of the credit for its size and magnificence to its Scoutmaster, Bill Shaffer. Bill has been the scoutmaster for over 40 years, and is an integral part of why Troop 26 is as successful as it is today. I personally owe him a great deal, as he has given me much of my work ethic and common sense.
